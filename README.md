# Common data sets

A collection of datasets that come in useful for my intro to programming classes.

## Licensing note

I've had most of these datasets residing in various project folders for a number of years and have lost track of their original sources. As such:

* No warranty regarding the accuracy or currency of the data within - use it for testing purposes only.
* Apologies if I am breaching an IP license by hosting the data myself - please advise any infringing material and it will be removed.
